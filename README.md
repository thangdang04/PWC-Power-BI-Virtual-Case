# Data visualization project on PWC database using Power BI
## Overview
In this project, I will be an employee at PwC Switzerland and use their datasets to create some dashboards in Power BI for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. In the end, I also do some analysis and give some insights into these dashboards to provide stakeholders with more detailed understanding.

This project is divided into 3 main tasks:

- Task 1: Create a dashboard in Power BI for Call Center Manager that reflects all relevant KPIs and metrics to:

  - Customer satisfaction.
  
  - Calls answered/abandoned.
  
  - Calls by time.
  
  - Speed of answer.
  
  - Agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time vs calls answered).

- Task 2: Create 2 dashboards in Power BI for the Customer Retention Manager that reflects all relevant KPIs and metrics to customer retention.

- Task 3: Create a dashboard in Power BI for the HR manager that reflects all relevant KPIs and metrics to gender balance and diversity.

- About Call trends:

  - Customers have more problems with Streaming service.

  - The resolved rate is at a high rate (73.04%).

- About performance of agents:

  - The agent who satisfies customers most is Becky with a 12.02% of “Very good” rating.
 
  - The agent who has the highest resolved rate is Jim and he is effective with solving problems related to “Contract related” and “Admin Support”.

- About customer satisfaction:

  - The average customer satisfaction is at an acceptable rate with 3.40, mainly comes from “Average” (30.04%) and “Good” (29.11%) rating.

  - The correlation between call answered and call resolved is strongly positive which resulted in a increase in the customer satisfaction rate.

- Month-to-Month contracts, lack of online security and tech support, and issues with Fiber Optic service are some of the reasons for customer churn.

- Up to 36% of the customers are partners, with over double the churn rate compared to dependents.

- The customers have varying contract lengths, with a lot of them only staying for a month and some for up to 72 months.

- Customers taking longer contracts tend to be more loyal and stay with the company for a longer period of time.

- Customers are more likely to churn when the monthly charges are high, and there is a higher chance of churn when the total charges are lower.

- Employees who were promoted twice within two years had very low-performance ratings, while those who left had higher ratings.

- According to the data, it appears that a significant portion of employees has been stagnating in their current job level for more than two years, despite working diligently. Promotions have not been forthcoming, female directors, in particular, require more time to be nominated as executives compared to their male counterparts.

- There is a significant gender imbalance in the distribution of new hires and promotions for executive positions, despite the fact that these female directors perform better.

- A potential factor contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level is that the performance evaluations for promotion at management levels may not be entirely objective and honest. This could result in qualified female candidates being overlooked for executive positions, despite their superior performance compared to their male counterparts.
